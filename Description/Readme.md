🔧 Embedded Systems Internship
📌 Overview

This repository documents my Embedded Systems Internship, where I gained practical exposure to microcontrollers, embedded programming, and hardware–software integration.

The work carried out during this internship helped me understand how embedded concepts are applied in real-world systems, moving beyond theory into hands-on implementation.
